Quiz App - Flutter

Project Overview:

Purpose:
This project is a simple quiz application developed using the Flutter framework. The app fetches quiz data from a remote API (https://api.jsonserve.com/Uw5CrX), displays multiple-choice questions to the user, and shows the results after the user completes the quiz. The app also provides robust error handling for a seamless experience in case of network failures or issues with the data.

Core Features:
 Start Quiz: A button on the home screen allows the user to start the quiz.
 Multiple-Choice Questions: The user can answer multiple-choice questions with a set of options provided for each question.
 Results Summary: After completing the quiz, a summary screen will display the total points scored based on correct answers.
 Responsive UI: The app adapts well to various device screen sizes and orientations (portrait and landscape).
 API Integration: The app fetches quiz data from an external API endpoint and populates the quiz questions dynamically.
 Error Handling: If thereâ€™s an issue with the API request or data parsing, the app will display an appropriate error message.
